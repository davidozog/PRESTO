# this file contains tissue properties
# columns are: 
# (1) tissue name 
# (2) tissue label 
# (3) tissue default conductivity in siemens/meter
# (4) a 3 character flags from left to right:
#  -1- allow/disallow tissue to have source/sink 
#  -2- allow/disallow tissue to have dipoles
#  -3- allow/disallow tissue to have sensors

# Note: tissue labels must be unique, two tissues with the same 
# label triggers the code to abort
