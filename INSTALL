INSTALLATION
============
PRESTO requires python version 2.7 or higher.  On the Aciss cluster,
please use the default python version by running:

    module load python


1) ENVIRONMENT SETUP:

  To set up the PRESTO environment variable in bash: 
    export PRESTO=</path/to/your/presto/directory/>
  
  Then add PRESTO to your path:
    export PATH=$PATH:$PRESTO/bin


2) MATLAB SETUP:

  You can add PRESTO to your path in 1 of 2 ways, 
  depending on your preference:
  
  --> Via a Matlab startup script:

      If it does not already exist, create a Matlab startup file:
        mkdir -p ~/Documents/MATLAB
        vi ~/Documents/MATLAB/startup.m
      
      and append these lines to the startup.m file:
        % PRESTO:
        if isempty( getenv( 'PRESTO' ) ) 
        	display('Please set the PRESTO environment variable' );
        else
        	addpath( [getenv( 'PRESTO' ) , 'src/matlab'] );
        end

  or 

  --> By running the following command in Matlab when you want to use PRESTO:

        run /path/to/pesto/root/pesto_setpath.m

  

3) JAVA SETUP:

  If you plan on using Java adaptors, then you will need to add the following
  to your CLASSPATH environment variable:

    export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$PRESTO/src/Java


4) TEST INSTALLATION: 

  Refer to the PRESTO README file to see how to test the installation.
